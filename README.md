I’m excited to share my latest work on SQL and some data visualization! Here's what I worked on:

🔍 Worked on 80 SQL questions to analyze an e-commerce database.

📊 Database contains 7 tables: customer, order, order_items, products, sellers, payment, and geolocation.

🔗 Established connection between Jupyter Notebook and MySQL for seamless query execution.

📝 Solved each question and rechecked answers for accuracy using MySQL.

📈 Created visualizations for key insights on 3 to 4 questions, showcasing trends and patterns in the data.

🎀It was a rewarding experience, enhancing my SQL skills and understanding of e-commerce analytics. Looking forward to applying these insights in real-world scenarios!
